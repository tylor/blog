Todo:
- make posts sortable by created date
- make post fields repopulate if validation fails
- add post deletion
- make sure key index is incremented/loaded properly
- sometimes buggy when adding new posts, maybe a problem with the count still?
- add redirection when clicking login link on any page
- move validation to model, check for other places that need better separation
- port to backbone
